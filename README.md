# webwx-app
webwxApp SPA Html &amp; AngularJS Script Tracker for Web Wechat

# Quick Start

The purpose of creating this repository is to track the code change from <wx.qq.com>

What it is doing is:

1. Save https://wx.qq.com HTML to `orignal/index.html`
1. Save AngularJs JavsScript to `orignal/wxwebApp.js`
1. Format the above two files, and save them to `formatted/`
1. Check wether there has any update
1. Commit to Git Repository and use js file name as commit message

Now it's just started, I had put it in my cron.

Any suggestion is welcome.
